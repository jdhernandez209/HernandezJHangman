    Project Name: Hangman
    Project Description: Rebuild hangman with your own style. Organize the code in a way that you hypothetically would have originally set it up as.

Peer Review: Aaron Perez - I like the text style and button sounds to start and reset game, overall design looks good with the color scheme, game works.
